                <p>My name is Subash Shibu and I am a senior at Dublin High School. I am seeking to apply 
                    my technical knowledge in information science and psychology to 
                    contribute and make a social impact. I ultimately hope to work in 
                    the health care industry where I can explore the applications of information science.
                    I plan to study this throughout college and high school. Currently, I 
                    am enrolled in Digital Electronics, helping me further advance
                     my engineering skills. I currently know how to code in Python, Java, Javascript HTML5, 
                     and CSS. Next year I will be pursuing information science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</p>

                <p>
                    I am an ambitious, motivated leader who is willing to take risks. 
                    In 2018 I created a magic club in Dublin High school because I hoped 
                    to improve my leadership skills and along with that, wanted to share my 
                    interests with other students. It will make them great public speakers, 
                    but at the same time, I can also improve my soft skills. I know skills like 
                    these are crucial to communicating properly with others. During my free time, 
                    I like performing magic for homeless shelters, community centers, birthday parties
                     and I also love to learn new tricks. For more information check out my resume. I 
                     also enjoy playing chess and basketball. 
                    I prioritize being physically fit along with being mentally healthy.

                                I attended the Patriot Jet Foundation where our class had a tour on Jet 
                                Aircraft and Presentation on New Technologies in Flight. First, we 
                                investigated the Polish MIG-17F where we learned a lot of important
                                 techniques aircrafts use to sustain itself on the air. 
                                For example, I learned about the speed stem and how it helped the aircraft measure the speed. 
                                Overall this experience was very memorable for me because I learned a lot of new things 
                                which I was able to implement in my POE class.

                          I also participated in the LLNL IT Job shadow which was an amazing experience since it opened my eyes to how vast engineering can be. There are so many different jobs
                                from the software side to hands-on engineering. I also got to chance to tour the national ignition facility laser which was a cool experience. Overall, this was definitely
                                an eye-opener for all the differents fields in engineering and STEM in general.

                               Due to COVID-19 this field trip was conducted virtually yet I found this to be one of the most insightful experiences. There was a panel of scientists
                                who developed the diagnostic test and shared their journey with us. It was inspiring to see how they pivoted around the challenges of COVID-19 and adapted to

                              Kenny Lau is a student at Cal Poly Slo currently. My main take away from his talk was to remain proactive. As he mentioned towards the end, school is what you make of it. Even in high school he participated in a lot of entrepreneurship competitions and it later helped him at his startup accelerated program. Even in college Kenny sought after opportunities by competing in a lot of hackathons. He even placed second in his first hackathon and learned more about block chain. He later won the competition with his idea of sending cryptocurrency through text. Clearly, his efforts paid out in the end as he got a lot of publicity and mentorship from the people at Ripple. But even after he reached a great milestone he continued to work on his app and expand it for more people internationally

                                One guest speaker who had a major effect on me was Laura Kegelmeyer from 
                                the National Ignition Facility. She shared her intriguing experience 
                                about how she finally decided on working at Lawrence Livermore after 
                                attending various jobs. She explained how the largest laser in the world
                                 was stored in Livermore for research purposes. 
                                She also explained the impact this has on engineers and the infinite potential it has.
                                Laura’s talk exposed me to several disciplines which I have never even thought about it.

                            <p>When I partcipated in the mentorship program as a junior in high school I got to met Sridhar Kuppuswamy, a former employee at Apple. He explained his love for electronics and engineering in general.
                                His upbringing was particularly inspirational to me as he wasn't fortunate like me and didn't have many engineering opportunities when he lived in India. He also gave me life advice and how he was able to 
                                make the most out of college. Overall, the mentorship program was an amazing experience and I am glad I was lucky enough to be a part of it.

                            <p>The goal of this project was to design a bridge which was cost-efficient and stable in Bridge Designer. By working collaboratively with my partner we designed 4 bridges in total and chose a final bridge design by utilizing a decision matrix. Then we further modified that bridge design to finally make the most optimal bridge. I made two of the bridge designs and we ended up choosing my bridge design because it was the most cost-efficient and stable. I was responsible with documentation as well as making our designs cost-efficient. My partner Aleena on the other hand focused on making our bridge stable. I was able to make our bridge cost-efficient by making some of the materials hollow and changing the thickness as well. Overall it was a great project and I was able to understand a little about about what civil engineers experience.

                            <p>This is a python image manipulation project, and we were supposed to create many functions to satisfy our client. Our client wanted us to photoshop the image so that it has a border and many other artistic effects. My partner and I created six different functions for photoshopping our client's vision. I was in charge of creating a tint, border, and pencil sketch.  The border and tint were very easy because I only applied for some basic programs. The pencil sketch was a bit harder because it was a bit out of my scope, but I was still able to do it. I displayed three of these photoshops in the left.

I was mainly in charge of building the circuits for both series and parallel for our hydrogen-powered cell as well as solar-powered cell. I also helped develop our vehicle.

                            <p class="project-aside-paragraph"> For this project my group and I was supposed to find a programming library and study its use cases. For the backend we used an express web server running the latest version of Node.js. The main backend manager we used was Node.js because it was both versatile and had many 3rd party libraries. I was in charge of the front-end programming. The front end design library I ended up using was Material Lite design. Material design is a design philosophy designed by Google and is used throughout their app ecosystem on both Android and iOS.

                            <p>Millions of people are affected by different types of malware each year, placing their information at risk. It can be confusing for people to identify which types of malware exists on their devices while knowing what to do about it. For this project, my team and I designed, simulated, and breadboarded a circuit that will identify the types of malware present on a device based on certain characteristics. With these outputs, an appropriate method of eliminating the malware will also be outputted. I was responsible for creating a portion of the circuit which dealt with a specific type of malware called the "worm." I made a circuit using a circuit design software called Multisim. After making it on multisim I made the circuit on a breadboard. For further information please refer to our documentation
