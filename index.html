                <p>My name is Subash Shibu and I am a senior at Dublin High School. I am seeking to apply 
                    my technical knowledge in information science and psychology to 
                    contribute and make a social impact. I ultimately hope to work in 
                    the health care industry where I can explore the applications of information science.
                    I plan to study this throughout college and high school. Currently, I 
                    am enrolled in Digital Electronics, helping me further advance
                     my engineering skills. I currently know how to code in Python, Java, Javascript HTML5, 
                     and CSS.</p>

                <p>
                    I am an ambitious, motivated leader who is willing to take risks. 
                    In 2018 I created a magic club in Dublin High school because I hoped 
                    to improve my leadership skills and along with that, wanted to share my 
                    interests with other students. It will make them great public speakers, 
                    but at the same time, I can also improve my soft skills. I know skills like 
                    these are crucial to communicating properly with others. During my free time, 
                    I like performing magic for homeless shelters, community centers, birthday parties
                     and I also love to learn new tricks. For more information check out my resume. I 
                     also enjoy playing chess and basketball. 
                    I prioritize being physically fit along with being mentally healthy.

                                I attended the Patriot Jet Foundation where our class had a tour on Jet 
                                Aircraft and Presentation on New Technologies in Flight. First, we 
                                investigated the Polish MIG-17F where we learned a lot of important
                                 techniques aircrafts use to sustain itself on the air. 
                                For example, I learned about the speed stem and how it helped the aircraft measure the speed. 
                                Overall this experience was very memorable for me because I learned a lot of new things 
                                which I was able to implement in my POE class.

                                One guest speaker who had a major effect on me was Laura Kegelmeyer from 
                                the National Ignition Facility. She shared her intriguing experience 
                                about how she finally decided on working at Lawrence Livermore after 
                                attending various jobs. She explained how the largest laser in the world
                                 was stored in Livermore for research purposes. 
                                She also explained the impact this has on engineers and the infinite potential it has.
                                Laura’s talk exposed me to several disciplines which I have never even thought about it.

                            <p>The goal of this project was to design a bridge which was cost-efficient and stable in Bridge Designer. By working collaboratively with my partner we designed 4 bridges in total and chose a final bridge design by utilizing a decision matrix. Then we further modified that bridge design to finally make the most optimal bridge. I made two of the bridge designs and we ended up choosing my bridge design because it was the most cost-efficient and stable. I was responsible with documentation as well as making our designs cost-efficient. My partner Aleena on the other hand focused on making our bridge stable. I was able to make our bridge cost-efficient by making some of the materials hollow and changing the thickness as well. Overall it was a great project and I was able to understand a little about about what civil engineers experience.

I was in charge of creating a tint, border, and pencil sketch.  The border and tint were very easy because I only applied for some basic programs. The pencil sketch was a bit harder because it was a bit out of my scope, but I was still able to do it. I displayed three of these photoshops in the left.

                            <p class="project-aside-paragraph">We had to create a car made of vex parts. The goal was to determine which power source was the most efficient and to do that we made a solar hydrogen car. We had to meet certain constraints and to do so, we had to plan out a lot. Overall this project was fun and gave me a good idea of what hands-on building is like. I was mainly in charge of building the circuits for both series and parallel for our hydrogen-powered cell as well as solar-powered cell. I also helped develop our vehicle.

                            <p>Millions of people are affected by different types of malware each year, placing their information at risk. It can be confusing for people to identify which types of malware exists on their devices while knowing what to do about it. For this project, my team and I designed, simulated, and breadboarded a circuit that will identify the types of malware present on a device based on certain characteristics. With these outputs, an appropriate method of eliminating the malware will also be outputted. I was responsible for creating a portion of the circuit which dealt with a specific type of malware called the "worm." I made a circuit using a circuit design software called Multisim. After making it on multisim I made the circuit on a breadboard. For further information please refer to our documentation
